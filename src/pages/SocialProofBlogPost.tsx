              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Human beings are wired to follow the crowd. When we're uncertain, we look to others for guidance—whether that's choosing a restaurant, a new gadget, or a service provider. Psychologists call this phenomenon social proof.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In the digital economy of 2025, social proof has become more important than ever. Reviews, testimonials, influencer shoutouts, and social media buzz all count. But one form of social proof consistently stands above the rest: press coverage.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Being featured in respected news outlets not only validates your brand—it transforms how customers behave. This article explores why press coverage is the ultimate form of social proof, how it shapes decisions, and how you can leverage it to accelerate growth.

              <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-primary">What Is Social Proof, and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Social proof is the idea that people conform to the actions of others under the assumption that those actions reflect the correct behavior. In business, that translates to: if other people trust this brand, I can trust it too.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-muted/30 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Forms of social proof include:</h3>
                <ul className="space-y-3">
                  <li>• Customer reviews & star ratings</li>
                  <li>• Testimonials and case studies</li>
                  <li>• Influencer endorsements</li>
                  <li>• Social media shares and virality</li>
                  <li>• <strong>Press mentions in mainstream outlets</strong></li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p className="font-semibold">
                The last one—press coverage—carries unique weight because it comes from independent third parties who are widely trusted. While anyone can write a testimonial or post a review, only credible news outlets can grant the authority of their platform.

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-secondary">1. Authority Transfer</h3>
                  <p>When your brand appears in NBC, USA Today, or Forbes, you inherit part of their credibility. Consumers instinctively assume: If the media is covering this, it must be legitimate.</p>
                </div>

                  <p>Press outlets have massive audiences. A single mention can put your brand in front of tens of thousands of readers overnight. Even if they don't all convert immediately, the impression lasts.</p>
                </div>

                  <p>Buying from a new brand always carries perceived risk. Press logos on your website reduce hesitation by signaling that trusted gatekeepers have already vetted you.</p>

                  <li><strong>It increases conversions.</strong> Brands with press logos on their landing pages see higher signup and purchase rates.</li>
                  <li><strong>It creates lasting impressions.</strong> Even customers who don't buy immediately often remember your name because of the authority boost.</li>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The challenge? Traditional PR agencies often charge $5,000–$10,000/month with no guarantee of placement. That has kept press coverage out of reach for small businesses, coaches, and entrepreneurs.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                But it doesn't have to be that way. At Just Featured, we make press coverage accessible to everyone—with guaranteed publication starting at just $97. That means you can leverage the power of social proof without draining your budget.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Customer behavior is shaped by perception. And perception is shaped by social proof. While reviews and testimonials matter, press coverage is the most powerful trust accelerator available.
